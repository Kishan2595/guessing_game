# guessing_game
A beginner programming problem in Rust: a guessing_game
* How it works: The programme will generate a random number between 1 to 100. It will prompt the player to enter a guess. 
After a guess is entered the programme will indicate whether the guess is low or high. 
Although if the guess is correct, the game will print a congratulatory message and exit.
